# Book Notes Project

This is a small project I did to practice working with a full application stack: frontend uses React and tailwind, backend is express.js, and database
is PostgreSQL. This is a CRUD app for book notes.

## Features

- view book note entries with a cover image provided by Open Library
- edit book note entries
- add new book notes entries
- sort books by most recent, highest rating, and alphanumerically by title
- search for book entries by author or title
